# Couple Sweeper

- A couple sweeper is a variation of windows minesweeper and it requires 16 bit operating system for run
- Therefore, 64-bit windows cannot run it anymore
- This project re-implement the original game as same as possible: graphics, mechanism, and features
    - Uses heart as a graphic instead of bomb and flags
    - Supports for the maximum size and 2-player mode
- This implementation starts from the code base of [Reversing Minesweeper](https://github.com/repnz/ReversingMinesweeper)
- Requires Microsoft Visual Studio for compilation (more details will be specified soon)
